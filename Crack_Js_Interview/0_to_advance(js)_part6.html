<!-- 

BODMAS stands for Bracket, Of, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction.
B --- Brackets open
O --- Of
D --- Division
M --- Multiplication
A --- Addition
S --- Subtraction

=> JavaScript Operator Precedence:

Operator precedence describes the order in which operations are performed in an arithmetic expression.
Multiplication (*) and division (/) have higher precedence than addition (+) and subtraction (-).

As in traditional mathematics, multiplication is done first:
let x = 100 + 50 * 3; //250(100+150=250)

When using parentheses, operations inside the parentheses are computed first:
let x = (100 + 50) * 3; //450(150*3=450)

Operations with the same precedence (like * and /) are computed from left to right:
let x = 100 / 50 * 3; //6(2*3=6)

=> JavaScript Scope
Scope determines the accessibility (visibility) of variables.

JavaScript has 3 types of scope:

1) Block scope
2) Function scope
3) Global scope


1) Block Scope:
Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had only Global Scope and Function Scope.
ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const.
These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript.
Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block:

Example:
{
  let x = 2;
}
console.log(x);
// x can NOT be used here(caught ReferenceError: x is not defined)


{
  const x = 2;
}
console.log(x);
// x can NOT be used here(caught ReferenceError: x is not defined)

{
  var x = 2;
}
console.log(x);
// x can be used here


2) Local Scope:
Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function.
Example:
// code here can not use carName
function myFunction() {
  let carName = "Volvo";
  // code here can use carName
}
// code here can not use carName


3) Function Scope:
JavaScript has function scope: Each function creates a new scope.
Variables defined inside a function are not accessible (visible) from outside the function.
Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared inside a function.
They all have Function Scope:
Example:
function myFunction() {
  var carName = "Volvo";   // Function Scope
}

function myFunction() {
  let carName = "Volvo";   // Function Scope
}

function myFunction() {
  const carName = "Volvo";   // Function Scope
}


4) Global Scope:
Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope.
Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program.
Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block.

They all have Global Scope:
Example:
var x = 2;       // Global scope
let x = 2;       // Global scope
const x = 2;     // Global scope



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



=> JavaScript Hoisting:
Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top.

Example:
//var
carName = "Volvo";
var carName;
console.log(carName); //Volvo

//let
carName = "Volvo";
let carName;
console.log(carName); //ReferenceError

//const
carName = "Volvo";
const carName;
console.log(carName); //ReferenceError

Note:
     Declare Your Variables At the Top !
Hoisting is (to many developers) an unknown or overlooked behavior of JavaScript.
If a developer doesn't understand hoisting, programs may contain bugs (errors).
To avoid bugs, always declare all variables at the beginning of every scope.
Since this is how JavaScript interprets the code, it is always a good rule.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



=> JavaScript Use Strict:
"use strict"; Defines that JavaScript code should be executed in "strict mode".

car = "Fortuner";
console.log(car); //Fortuner

"use strict";

//Wrong
car = "Fortuner";
console.log(car); // This will cause an error

//Right
var car = "Fortuner";
console.log(car); //Fortuner



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



=> The JavaScript this Keyword:

In JavaScript, the this keyword refers to an object.
Which object depends on how this is being invoked (used or called).
The this keyword refers to different objects depending on how it is used:

In an object method, this refers to the object.

Alone, this refers to the global object.

In a function, this refers to the global object.

In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined.

In an event, this refers to the element that received the event.

Methods like call(), apply(), and bind() can refer this to any object.

Example:
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName : "Doe",
  id       : 5566,
  fullName : function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
};
console.log(person.fullName()); //John Doe



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



=> JavaScript Arrow Function:
Arrow functions were introduced in ES6-2015.

Arrow functions allow us to write shorter function syntax:

Example:

Before Arrow Function:

hello = function(a,b) {
  return a*b;
}
console.log(hello(10,20)); //200

---------------------------------------------

With Arrow Function:

var myFun = (a,b) =>{
   return a*b;
}
console.log(myFun(10,20)); //200

---------------------------------------------

Arrow Functions Return Value by Default:
Example:
hello = (a,b) => a*b;
console.log(hello(10,20)); //200

Note: This works only if the function has only one statement.

---------------------------------------------

Arrow Function Without Parentheses:
Example:
hello = val => "Hello " + val;
console.log(hello("Golu")); //Hello Golu



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



=> JavaScript Modules:
Modules:

JavaScript modules allow you to break up your code into separate files.
This makes it easier to maintain a code-base.
Modules are imported from external files with the import statement.
Modules also rely on type="module" in the <script> tag.

Example:

//    import message from "./message.js";


--------------------------------------------

Named Exports:
Let us create a file named person.js, and fill it with the things we want to export.
You can create named exports two ways. In-line individually, or all at once at the bottom.

In-line individually:
person.js

export const name = "Jesse";
export const age = 40;

All at once at the bottom:
person.js

const name = "Jesse";
const age = 40;

export {name, age};


Import:
You can import modules into a file in two ways, based on if they are named exports or default exports.
Named exports are constructed using curly braces. Default exports are not.

Import from named exports
Import named exports from the file person.js:

import { name, age } from "./person.js";

--------------------------------------------

Default Exports
Let us create another file, named message.js, and use it for demonstrating default export.

You can only have one default export in a file.

Example:
message.js

const message = () => {
const name = "Jesse";
const age = 40;
return name + ' is ' + age + 'years old.';
};

export default message;


Import from default exports
Import a default export from the file message.js:

import message from "./message.js";

Note:
Modules only work with the HTTP(s) protocol.
A web-page opened via the file:// protocol cannot use import / export.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


=>JavaScript JSON:

JSON is a format for storing and transporting data.
JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page.

What is JSON?
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
JSON is a lightweight data interchange format
JSON is language independent *
JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand

JSON Example:
This JSON syntax defines an employees object: an array of 3 employee records (objects):

{
"employees":[
  {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"},
  {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"},
  {"firstName":"Peter", "lastName":"Jones"}
]
}

---------------------------------------------------

JSON Syntax Rules:
1)Data is in name/value pairs
2)Data is separated by commas
3)Curly braces hold objects
4)Square brackets hold arrays

---------------------------------------------------
              
Converting a JSON Text to a JavaScript Object
JSON.parse(text);

---------------------------------------------------

=> eval():
The eval() function evaluates JavaScript code represented as a string and returns its completion value. The source is parsed as a script.

eval('2 + 2');
// Expected output: 4
