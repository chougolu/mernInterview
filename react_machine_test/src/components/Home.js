                    This homepage is one of our absolute favorites. The look and feel of the website is brilliantly designed, and the interactive elements (play around with them for yourself!) take this homepage to a whole new level.A great feature of this homepage is that the highlighted items are neatly presented for all to see. Youâ€™ll also notice the simple but attractive scrolling slideshow at the top, which helps give visitors additional information without adding clutter.
