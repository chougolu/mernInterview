ReactJS - architecture:
1) React app starts with a single root component.
2) Root component is build using one or more component.
3) Each component can be nested with other component to any level.
4) Composition is one of the core concepts of React library. So, each
component is build by composing smaller components instead of inheriting
one component from another component.
5) Most of the components are user interface components.

React app can include third party component for specific purpose such as routing, animation, state management, etc.
