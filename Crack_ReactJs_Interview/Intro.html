ReactJs:
React is an open source, JavaScript library for developing user interface (UI)
in web application. React is developed and released by Facebook.
React is a tool for building user interface(UI).
React is used to build single-page applications.
Node.js and react.js -----> single threaded.

React js creates a VIRTUAL DOM in memory.

Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React 
creates a virtual DOM in memory, where it does all the necessary
manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM.
React only changes what needs to be changed!

React.JS History:
Current version of React.JS is V18.0.0 (April 2022).
Initial Release to the Public (V0.3.0) was in July 2013.
React.JS was first used in 2011 for Facebook's Newsfeed feature.
Facebook Software Engineer, Jordan Walke, created it.
Current version of create-react-app is v5.0.1 (April 2022).

Features:
The salient features of React library are as follows −
1) Solid base architecture.
2) Extensible architecture.
3) Component based library.
4) JSX based design architecture.
5) Declarative UI library.

Benefits:
Few benefits of using React library are as follows −
1) Easy to learn.
2) Easy to adept in modern as well as legacy application.
3) Faster way to code a functionality.
4) Availability of large number of ready-made component.
5) Large and active community.

Applications:
Few popular websites powered by React library are listed below −
1) Facebook, popular social media application.
2) Instagram, popular photo sharing application.
3) Netflix, popular media streaming application.
4) Code Academy, popular online training application.
5) Reddit, popular content sharing application.

Babel compiler:
Babel is a JavaScript compiler which compiles many variant (es2015, es6, etc.,) 
of JavaScript into standard JavaScript code supported by all browsers.

React Render HTML:
React's goal is in many ways to render HTML in a web page.
React renders HTML to the web page by using a function called createRoot() and its method render().

React JSX:
What is JSX?
JSX stands for JavaScript XML.
JSX allows us to write HTML in React.
JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.
JSX converts HTML tags into react elements

React Events:
Just like HTML DOM events, React can perform actions based on user events.
React has the same events as HTML: click, change, mouseover etc.

React Lists:
In React, you will render lists with some type of loop.
The JavaScript map() array method is generally the preferred method.

React Router:
React Router is a JavaScript framework that lets us handle client and 
server-side routing in React applications. It enables the creation of 
single-page web or mobile apps that allow navigating without refreshing 
the page. It also allows us to use browser history features while preserving 
the right application view.

Private Router:
Path: /src/_components/PrivateRoute.jsx
The react private route component renders child components (children) if the user 
is logged in. If not logged in the user is redirected to the /login page with the return 
url passed in the location state property.

React Props:
pass data from one component to another, as parameters.

React Components:
Components are like functions that return HTML elements.
Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript 
functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.
Components come in two types, Class components and Function components.

Class component:
Example:
Create a Class component called Car

class Car extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
  }
}


Functional component:
Example:
Create a Function component called Car

function Car() {
  return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
}



Difference between class component and functional component-

Sr.           Functional component                           Class component
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.      A functional component is just a                 A class component requires you to extend 
        plain JavaScript pure function that              from React. Component and create a render 
        accepts props as an argument and returns         function that returns a React element.
        a React element(JSX).

2.      Hooks can be easily used in                      It requires different syntax inside a
        functional components to make                    class component to implement hooks(constructor).
        them Stateful.

3.      Constructors are not used.                       Constructor is used as it needs to

4.      Functional components cannot use React           Class components can use React lifecycle methods
        lifecycle methods, such as componentDidMount.    (for example, componentDidMount, componentWillUnmount etc).
