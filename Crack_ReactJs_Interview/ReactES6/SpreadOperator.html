React ES6 Spread Operator

With the help of spread operator we can concat two array:
Example:
var arr1 = [1,2,3,4,5];
var arr2 = [6,7,8,9,10];

var arr3 = [...arr1,...arr2];

Also with the help of spread operator we can concat two object:
Example:
var obj1 = {"name":"Golu"};
var obj2 = {"lastName":"Choudhary"};

var obj3 = {...obj1,...obj2};

//swapping two array without any third array.
<script>
    var arr1 = [1,2,3,4];
    var arr2 = [5,6,7,8];
    [arr1,arr2] = [arr2,arr1]
    console.log(arr1,arr2)
</script>
