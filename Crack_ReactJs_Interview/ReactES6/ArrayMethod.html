React ES6 Array Methods

Array Methods:
There are many JavaScript array methods.
One of the most useful in React is the .map() array method.
The .map() method allows you to run a function on each item in the array, returning a new array as the result.

In React, map() can be used to generate lists.

Example:
Generate a list of items from an array:

var array = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8];
var newArray = array.map((item,index)=>{
    return item;
});
console.log(newArray); //1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8
